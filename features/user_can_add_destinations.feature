Feature: User can add destinations
  As a User
  I want to add Destinations
  So that I can assign my Bucket List entries

@javascript
Scenario:  User creates uniquely named destinations
  Given I am a registered and signed in user
  When I am in my profile
  And I add a new destination
  And I fill and submit destinationÂ´s required information
  Then a new Destination is created
